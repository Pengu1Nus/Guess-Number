## 🎓 About 
As part of the JavaScript Basics course, I completed the Guess Number project.

Throughout this project, I learned various JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and generating random numbers. Additionally, I learned how to manipulate with CSS using JavaScript to style the web page according to different events.

Overall, this project helped me to improve my JavaScript skills and gave me hands-on experience in building a simple web application from scratch. It was a great opportunity to practice and solidify my understanding of core JavaScript concepts.
